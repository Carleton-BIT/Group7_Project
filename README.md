# Group7_Project
The goal of this project is to aid Carleton Univeristy students in their everyday life while on campus.

  Everyday many Carleton students wonder or need different services offered by Carleton university, however getting access to clubs and services can be a challenge as information is often hard to find or even missing. Students should be aware of all the great services offered here on campus, by having accurate and detailed descriptions and information. 
  Our service will offer a breif overview, Contact information and location information of services and clubs offered on Carleton's Campus. Rather than having services spread out across many different websites, ours will condence and display information effectively
